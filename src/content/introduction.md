	  <p class="medium">
	    We first present two surveys conducted with students on
	    the intuitiveness of syntax, which we used to garner
	    formative clues on what words and symbols might be easy
	    for novices to understand. We followed up with two studies
	    on the accuracy rates of novices using a total of six
	    programming languages: Ruby, Java, Perl, Python, Randomo,
	    and Quorum. To our surprise, we found that <strong>languages using
	    a more traditional C-style syntax (both Perl and Java) did
	    not afford accuracy rates significantly higher than a
	    language with randomly generated keywords, but that
	    languages which deviate (Quorum, Python, and Ruby) did</strong>.

	  <p>It depends what you mean by "better"...
	  <p>Here's <a href="https://pleiad.cl/papers/2014/hanenbergAl-emse2014.pdf">a result from 2014</a>
	  <p class="medium">
	    This paper describes an experiment that tests whether
	    static type systems improve the maintainability of
	    software systems, in terms of understanding undocumented
	    code, fixing type errors, and fixing semantic errors.  The
	    results show rigorous empirical evidence
	    that <strong>static types are indeed beneficial to these
	    activities, except when fixing semantic
	    errors</strong>. [Our] exploratory analysis [shows] that
	    developers using a dynamic type system tend to look at
	    different files more frequently when doing programming
	    tasksâ€”which is a potential reason for the observed
	    differences in time.

	  <p>How and why do developers actually draw pictures?
	  <blockquote>
	    <em>
	      Most of the diagrams had a transient nature because of
	      the high cost of changing whiteboard sketches to
	      electronic renderings. Diagrams that documented design
	      decisions were often externalized in these temporary
	      drawings and then subsequently lost.  Current
	      visualization tools and the software development
	      practices that we observed do not solve these issues,

	    CS professors a series of histograms displaying ambiguous

	    to think about the fact that CS grades are commonly
	    thought to be bimodal; these participants were more likely
	    to label ambiguous distributions as "bimodal".
	    Participants were also more likely to label distributions

	  <p>Look at build coupling (how frequently source code changes require build changes) and build ownership (proportion of developers involved in build maintenance)
	  <blockquote>
	    <em>
	      The build system churn rate is comparable to that of the
	      source code, and build changes induce more relative
	      churn on the build system than source code changes
	      induce on the source code. Furthermore, build
	      maintenance yields up to a 27% overhead on source code
	      development and a 44% overhead on test development. Up
	      to 79% of source code developers and 89% of test code
	      developers are significantly impacted by build
	      maintenance, yet investment in build experts can reduce
	      the proportion of impacted developers to 22% of source
	      code developers and 24% of test code developers.
